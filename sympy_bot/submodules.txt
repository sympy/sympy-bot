# This is a list of SymPy submodules, which are valid headers for the release
# notes. New top-level modules or major submodules should be added here. Keep
# the entries in alphabetical order, as the order here is the order used in
# the release notes. Each line should have one valid header. Blank lines and
# lines that that start with a # are ignored.
